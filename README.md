# Gatsby Plugin GraphQL Preview

_This plugin is in a pretty early status. Use at your own risk._

_Requires React 16.8 or newer (it uses hooks ðŸ¤«)_

> **This Gatsby plugin automatically makes the source-graphql parts of your
> application available as a live updating preview.**

This plugin works by doing the following:

1. Everytime a page is created, make a (marked) copy of it.
2. Grab the pages graphql query, isoloate the parts that belong to the remote
   graphql source and make it available to the copied page.
3. Wrap each copied and marked page inside an apollo setup, that replaces the
   statically queried remote data with fresh data queried on the client.
4. Add a tiny UI to control how and when to re-query the data.

It only works conjunction with `gatsby-source-graphql`.

## Install

with yarn

```
yarn add gatsby-plugin-graphql-preview
```

<details>
<summary>with npm</summary>

```
npm install --save gatsby-plugin-graphql-preview
```

</details>

## How to use

Add the plugin to the plugins array in your `gatsby-config.js`.

It requires the same configuration options as gatsby-source-graphql. I'd suggest
extracting the configuration into a variable instead of copying it.

_`gatsby-source-graphql`s `createLink` is not yet supported. The `url` field is
required._

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js

const graphqlOptions = {
  typeName: 'SWAPI',
  fieldName: 'swapi',
  url: 'https://api.graphcms.com/simple/v1/swapi',
};

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-source-graphql',
      options: graphqlOptions,
    },
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-graphql-preview',
      options: graphqlOptions,
    },
  ],
};
```

Open a page that includes a query to your graphql-source and prepend `_preview/`
to your pathname in the browser. It should include a small ui to configure in
which interval the endpoint should be polled.

## To do
